# LinkedIn Bio — Personal (Connor Goulding)

## DRAFT 1

I don't hand you a strategy deck and walk away.

I build the systems that actually run your business. Operations, AI with guardrails, and marketing automation — done in 4-8 weeks, not 6 months.

I led conversational AI and ethical AI at Microsoft. Spent 8 years as a CMO-level marketing consultant. Now I combine both: I understand your problem, and I can build the solution.

Most consultants diagnose. I fix.
