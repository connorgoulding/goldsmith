## DRAFT 1

---

### HEADLINE:

**The Operating System Your Business Is Missing**

*Subhead:* Operations, AI, and marketing — one team that fixes what Big 4 consultants diagnose but can't build.

---

### OPENING:

You hired McKinsey. They gave you a 200-slide deck and a bill for $500K.

You hired Deloitte. They told you what was wrong. They didn't fix it.

You hired the AI agency. They built a chatbot that hallucinates and scares your customers.

**Here's what actually works:** One team that can diagnose the problem AND build the solution.

Operations. AI. Marketing. Done.

---

### WHO WE ARE:

**Not Another Deck Shop**

Most consulting firms sell you insights. We sell you outcomes.

Our founding team led conversational AI and ethical AI at Microsoft. We built the guardrails that keep AI safe in production environments. We know what breaks — and how to prevent it.

Combined with 8 years as CMO-level marketing consultants and operations specialists who've actually run P&Ls, we bring something rare:

**Strategy that ships.**

---

### WHAT WE DO:

**Three Practices. One Outcome.**

#### 1. Operations Consulting
We map your workflow, find the bottlenecks, and fix them. Not with another process document — with systems that actually run.

- Workflow automation that eliminates busywork
- Process redesign that actually gets adopted
- Systems integration that doesn't require a 6-month IT project

**Recent win:** 1,000-agent real estate brokerage — 45 hours of admin work eliminated weekly, lead volume doubled in 90 days.

---

#### 2. AI Implementation (With Guardrails)

Everyone's building AI agents. Almost nobody's building them safely.

Our founding team led conversational AI and ethical AI at Microsoft. We know the failure modes. We build the guardrails first.

- AI agents that actually work in production
- Safety frameworks that prevent hallucinations and bias
- Compliance guardrails for regulated industries
- Human-in-the-loop systems that maintain control

**Recent win:** Cosmetic surgery practice — 10x improvement in lead conversion, response time from 13 hours to 90 seconds, zero AI incidents.

---

#### 3. CMO-Level Marketing

Strategy without execution is just theory. We do both.

- Marketing operations that scale
- Creative automation that maintains brand standards
- Performance intelligence that actually drives decisions
- Attribution that makes sense

**Recent win:** Branding agency serving 40+ clients — 4x increase in qualified leads, 72 hours of reporting work automated weekly.

---

### THE DIFFERENCE:

**Why We Win Where Others Fail**

| The Big 4 | Goldsmith |
|-----------|-----------|
| 200-slide decks | Working systems |
| Junior associates | Founders who build |
| 6-month timelines | 4-8 week delivery |
| $500K+ projects | $15-40K builds |
| Insights | Outcomes |

**The AI Agencies:** Build fast, break things, leave you with a PR crisis.

**Us:** Build fast, build safe, ship systems that actually work.

---

### THE PROCESS:

**Phase 1: The Consulting Audit ($2,500)**
We spend a week inside your business. We map your operations, identify AI opportunities, audit your marketing, and find the quick wins that pay for the rest.

You get:
- Complete workflow analysis
- AI readiness assessment (with safety recommendations)
- Marketing operations audit
- Prioritized roadmap with ROI projections
- Go/no-go decision framework

**Phase 2: The Build ($15,000-$75,000)**
We build the systems, implement the AI, or overhaul the marketing. Working systems in 4-8 weeks.

**Phase 3: Optimization ($5,000-$15,000/month)**
We stay on as your operating partner. New challenges, new systems, continuous improvement.

---

### PROOF:

**Real Results. Real Clients.**

**Real Estate Brokerage (1,000 agents):**
- Problem: 45 hours/week of admin work drowning hiring managers
- Solution: Automated application routing, follow-up sequences, lead distribution
- Result: Lead volume doubled, $58,500 annual savings, 4.9x ROI

**Cosmetic Surgery Practice:**
- Problem: $8K/month in ads, 4-24 hour response time, poor conversion
- Solution: 90-second response system, automated nurture sequences
- Result: 10x efficiency improvement, cost per procedure $2,667 → $421

**Branding Agency (40+ clients):**
- Problem: Account managers spending 60% of time on reporting
- Solution: Automated reporting stack, lead boost system
- Result: 4x more qualified leads, 72 hours/week saved

---

### THE CALL:

**Book a Consulting Audit**

One week. $2,500. We diagnose your operations, assess your AI readiness, and audit your marketing.

You get a clear plan for what to fix, in what order, with what ROI.

No pitch. Just a plan you can use — with us or without us.

## SELF-SCORING:

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Clarity** | 88 | Clear three-practice structure, "Operating System" concept works |

| **Flow** | 85 | Good progression, comparison table adds clarity |
| **Urgency** | 80 | Present but could be stronger |

**Total: 87.5%** — Good but needs refinement.

## REWRITE: HEADLINE + OPENING

### HEADLINE:

**McKinsey Gives You Decks. We Give You Working Systems.**

*Subhead:* Operations, AI, and marketing — one team that diagnoses AND builds.

### OPENING:

You paid McKinsey $500K. They handed you a 200-slide deck and walked away.

You paid the AI agency $50K. They built a chatbot that hallucinates your pricing and insults your customers.

You paid the marketing firm $30K/month. They ran ads and sent you reports nobody read.

**Nobody actually fixed anything.**

---

### RE-SCORE:

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| **Clarity** | 92 |
| **Desire** | 93 |
| **Credibility** | 92 |
| **Flow** | 88 |
