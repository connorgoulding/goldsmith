# Homepage Headline Alternatives (More Succinct)

## Current (Problematic):
**Line 1:** They give you PowerPoints.
**Line 2:** We give you working systems.
**Issue:** Line 2 is too long for 10rem font, creates clashing

---

## OPTION 1: Parallel Structure, Shorter

**Line 1:** They sell you plans.
**Line 2:** We build the machine.

**Why it works:**
- Parallel structure (They/We)
- "Plans" vs "machine" — concrete contrast
- Both lines short, balanced
- "Machine" implies systems, operations, automation
- 4 words each

---

## OPTION 2: Direct + Punchy

**Line 1:** Consultants diagnose.
**Line 2:** We fix.

**Why it works:**
- Ultra-short, dramatic
- "Diagnose" implies they stop at the problem
- "Fix" implies completion
- Creates curiosity gap
- Active verbs

---

## OPTION 3: Problem/Solution

**Line 1:** Slide decks don't ship.
**Line 2:** We do.

**Why it works:**
- References the McKinsey/Big 4 problem indirectly
- "Don't ship" — startup language
- "We do" — confident, short
- Memorable, shareable

---

## OPTION 4: Question/Answer

**Line 1:** Tired of consultants who don't build?
**Line 2:** We build.

**Why it works:**
- Directly addresses pain
- Question creates engagement
- Simple answer lands hard
- But might be too long for line 1

---

## OPTION 5: Metaphor (Jony Ive Style)

**Line 1:** They sketch.
**Line 2:** We architect.

**Why it works:**
- Elegant, design-forward language
- "Sketch" = surface level
- "Architect" = deep, structural, permanent
- Appeals to operations mindset
- Very short, balanced

---

## OPTION 6: Time-Focused

**Line 1:** 90 days of talk.
**Line 2:** Or systems that work.

**Why it works:**
- Specific (90 days = typical consulting timeline)
- "Talk" vs "work" — clear value prop
- Creates urgency
- But line 2 is still long

---

## OPTION 7: The Winner?

**Line 1:** They plan.
**Line 2:** We execute.

**Why it works:**
- Classic business terminology
- Perfect parallel structure
- Both 2 words
- Clear, undeniable contrast
- Fits perfectly with your three services (you do all three: plan + build + run)
- Actually, this might be too generic...

---

## OPTION 8: Your Actual Value Prop

**Line 1:** Strategy without systems.
**Line 2:** That's the problem.

**Why it works:**
- States the problem clearly
- Implies you're the solution
- Short lines
- But might be too abstract

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: Option 1 or 5

**Option 1:** "They sell you plans. We build the machine."
- Concrete, visual, operations-focused
- "Machine" encompasses automation + systems

**Option 5:** "They sketch. We architect."
- Most elegant, design-forward
- Appeals to your Jony Ive aesthetic
- Shortest, cleanest

---

## FINAL CHOICE:

**They sell you plans.**
**We build the machine.**

Or even shorter:

**They plan.**
**We build.**

This last one is ultra-clean and fits the visual style perfectly.
