## Copywriting Analysis

### Homepage Title
- **Clarity:** 95/100 — Clear three-service structure
- **Differentiation:** 90/100 — "Systems That Work" vs typical consultancies
- **SEO:** 88/100 — Includes "Operations, AI, Marketing"

### Homepage Description
- **Hook:** "slide decks" — calls out competitor weakness
- **Differentiation:** "4-8 week delivery" — specific timeline
- **Credibility:** "AI with guardrails" — safety positioning
- **Urgency:** Implied through contrast

### Key Improvements Over Old Copy:
1. ❌ Removed "B2B" — now broader
2. ✅ Added "growth-stage companies" — clearer target
3. ✅ Emphasized "systems that work" vs "plans"
4. ✅ Included AI safety/guardrails angle
5. ✅ Specific outcomes (10-20 hours, 4-8 weeks)

---

## AI Pattern Check ✅
- No "In today's fast-paced business environment"
- No buzzwords like "leverage" or "synergize"
- Active voice throughout
- Specific numbers and outcomes
- Strong opinions ("slide decks" vs "systems")
