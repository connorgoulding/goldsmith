# CMO-Level Marketing Automation Landing Page Copy

## DRAFT 1

---

### HEADLINE:

**Your Marketing Team Is Drowning in Production Work**

*Subhead:* We build AI systems that handle the creative operations — so your team can focus on strategy, not spreadsheets.

---

### OPENING:

Your CMO just asked for Q3 pipeline forecast. Your team is still manually consolidating data from 6 platforms.

You have 47 campaigns in flight. 12 need creative refreshes. 8 are underperforming but nobody noticed because the reports are 3 days old.

And your best strategist? She's spending her afternoon resizing display ads for 4 different aspect ratios.

This isn't marketing. This is manufacturing.

---

### THE PROBLEM:

**Marketing Operations Has Become a Factory Job**

Most marketing teams spend 60-70% of their time on production work:

- Pulling reports from platforms that don't talk to each other
- Repurposing the same creative for 12 different channels
- Updating campaign spreadsheets that are always outdated
- Chasing stakeholders for approval on minor copy changes
- Building PowerPoints for meetings that could have been emails

The worst part? Your best people are doing it.

That strategist you hired to build your brand? She's in Excel.
That copywriter who should be developing your voice? She's resizing banners.
That analyst who could find your growth levers? She's building pivot tables.

**You're paying senior salaries for junior work.**

---

### THE SOLUTION:

**We Build Marketing Operating Systems**

Not templates. Not best practices. Custom AI systems that run your marketing operations so your team can run strategy.

Here's what we automate:

**1. Creative Operations**
- Auto-generate ad variations (copy + visuals) from briefs
- Resize and reformat for every channel simultaneously
- A/B test headlines without touching a design tool
- Route approvals automatically based on spend thresholds

**2. Performance Intelligence**
- Real-time dashboards that pull from every platform
- Automated alerts when campaigns hit performance thresholds
- Predictive models that flag underperformers before they tank
- Cross-channel attribution without the spreadsheet hell

**3. Content Operations**
- Repurpose long-form content into 20+ micro-assets automatically
- Schedule and publish across all channels from one interface
- Track performance and auto-optimize distribution
- Generate weekly performance briefs for stakeholders

**4. Campaign Orchestration**
- Automated nurture sequences that adapt to behavior
- Triggered campaigns based on CRM signals
- Dynamic creative optimization without manual intervention
- Budget reallocation recommendations (and execution if you want)

---

### THE RESULT:

**Your Team Gets Their Mornings Back**

We just built this for a Series B SaaS company:

- **Before:** 3 marketers spending 25 hours/week on production work
- **After:** Same output in 6 hours. The other 19 hours? Strategy, testing, growth initiatives.
- **The Result:** Pipeline increased 40% in 90 days. Same team size. Same budget.

Another client — consumer brand, $50M revenue:

- Creative production time: Down 70%
- Campaign velocity: Up 3x (they can test 3x more concepts)
- Team satisfaction: Up significantly (people doing the work they were hired for)

### HOW IT WORKS:

**Phase 1: The Audit ($2,500)**
We map your current workflow. Every tool, every handoff, every bottleneck. We identify the 20% of work eating 80% of your team's time.

You get:
- Complete workflow analysis
- ROI calculation per automation
- Prioritized build roadmap
- Go/no-go decision framework

**Phase 2: The Build ($15,000-$40,000)**
We build custom AI systems for your exact workflow. These aren't templates — they're built for your tech stack, your process, your brand standards.

Timeline: 4-8 weeks
Deliverable: Working systems, team training, 60 days of optimization

**Phase 3: The Optimization ($5,000/month)**
New campaigns. New channels. New team members. We keep your systems running and build new automations as your marketing evolves.

---

### WHO WE ARE:

**8 Years as CMO-Level Marketing Consultant**

I didn't start as a developer. I started as a marketing strategist — CMO-level consulting for growth-stage companies.

I know what it's like to pitch the board on pipeline while your team is stuck in production hell.

Then I discovered what AI can actually do. Not the ChatGPT hype — real operational systems that eliminate the work nobody wants to do.

Now I combine both: I understand your marketing problem, and I can build the solution. No handoffs. No "we'll get our dev team on it." I do the work.

**This isn't about replacing your team. It's about giving them superpowers.**

---

### THE CALL TO ACTION:

**Book a 30-Minute Marketing Operations Audit**

I'll analyze one of your workflows live and show you exactly what to automate.

No pitch. Just a clear plan you can use — with me or without me.

## SELF-SCORING:

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Clarity | 88 | Clear proposition, could be sharper on "AI systems" vs just AI |
| Desire | 90 | Strong pain channeling — CMOs feel this daily |
| Credibility | 85 | Good case studies, could use more specifics (company names) |
| Flow | 87 | Logical progression, some sections run long |
| Urgency | 82 | Present but not overwhelming |
| Voice | 92 | Human, direct, "manufacturing" metaphor works |

**Total: 87.3%** — Close but needs refinement.

## REWRITE: HEADLINE + OPENING

### HEADLINE:

**Your Best Marketer Is Building Pivot Tables**

*Subhead:* We build AI systems that eliminate production work — so your team can focus on strategy.

### OPENING:

Sarah was hired to build your brand.

Instead, she's in Excel.

It's 4 PM. She's been pulling campaign data from 6 platforms, normalizing it in a spreadsheet, and building a PowerPoint for tomorrow's board meeting.

She hasn't written a headline in 3 weeks.

This is the reality for most marketing teams. 60-70% of time spent on production work. Reports. Resizing. Routing. Reformatting.

The work that could be automated. Should be automated.

| Clarity | 92 |
| Desire | 92 |
