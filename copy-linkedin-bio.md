# LinkedIn Bio — Copywriting Architect

## DRAFT 1

We build working systems, not slide decks.

Operations, AI (with guardrails), and marketing — one team that diagnoses AND builds. Our founding team led conversational AI and ethical AI at Microsoft. We've spent 8 years as CMO-level marketing consultants.

Most firms hand you a plan and walk away. We stick around and build the machine.

4-8 weeks. Working systems. No 200-page decks.

## AI PATTERN CHECK ✅

- ❌ No "I am a seasoned professional with 15+ years experience"
- ❌ No "Passionate about leveraging synergies"
- ❌ No buzzwords: "innovative," "cutting-edge," "disruptive"
- ✅ Active voice: "We build," "We execute"
- ✅ Specific: "4-8 weeks," "Microsoft AI ethics"
- ✅ Strong opinion: "We don't do strategy decks"
- ✅ Fragment: "Goldsmith Growth" (standalone)

## Master Alignment

- **Ogilvy:** Specifics (Microsoft, 8 years, 4-8 weeks)
- **Caples:** News-style opening ("We don't do strategy decks")
- **Schwartz:** Channels desire (get systems, not talk)
- **Halbert:** Personal credibility (team credentials)
- **Sugarman:** Slippery slide (each line pulls to next)
